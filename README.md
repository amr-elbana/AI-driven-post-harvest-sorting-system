# AI-Driven Deep Learning and Robotic Arm System for Post-Harvest Sorting of Fruits and Vegetables

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered system that automates the sorting process of fruits and vegetables post-harvest. Utilizing deep learning techniques, the system classifies produce as either healthy or defective, ensuring quality control before packaging. A robotic arm, integrated with the AI model, physically removes defective items from the production line.

### Key Features:
- **Deep Learning Classification**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a dataset of fruits and vegetables to distinguish between healthy and defective produce.
- **Robotic Arm Integration**: A programmable robotic arm connected to the system for real-time sorting actions, removing defective items from the conveyor belt.
- **Efficient Image Processing**: The system processes images in real time using models like YOLOv5 or VGG16 to detect and classify produce.
- **Cost-Effective Solution**: Designed to be a scalable and affordable system that leverages common hardware components such as cameras and Arduino-based robotic arms.

### Technologies Used:
- Deep Learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Computer Vision (OpenCV, YOLO)
- Robotic Arm Control (Arduino, Servo Motors)
- Hardware (Camera for capturing images, electric treadmill for conveyor belt)
  
### Objectives:
1. Improve efficiency in sorting fruits and vegetables using AI.
2. Reduce human errors and labor costs in post-harvest processes.
3. Ensure only quality produce reaches the market by accurately classifying items in real time.
